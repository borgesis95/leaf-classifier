# Leaf-classifier

This is a university project for machine learning course.  Goal of this project is build a classifier able to understand if a leaf is an ivy,medlar or laurel leave leaf.

## Requirements
- python3
- numpy
- pytorch
- torchvision
- torch
- gradio
- torchvision

Install running:
``` pip3 -r requirements.txt```

## Datasets

Dataset's gathering is part of this project. To do that, I recordered some videos of leaves placed on a white sheet , rotating  device on  different axis.  

Inside *src* folder you can find *01_extract-frames.py* which allow to extract frames (from *config.py* file you can select different parameters I.E frames number)

## Models

For this has been used three well-known model: *[AlexNet](hhttps://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf)*, *[ResNet](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)* and *[SqueezeNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360)*.
